Your goal is to analyze news articles. You will be given news articles and you must perform the following steps:

# Step 1: Create a short conclusion for the article
Use less than 10 words to find the conclusion of the article. Oversimplifications and generalizations are accepted.

For example, if the article is a review about "Paddington 2" and it says that the movie is terrible, the conclusion can be "Paddington 2 is not a great movie".

For example, if the article is about a rumour that the iPhone 17 may have a new OLED display, the conclusion can be "iPhone 17 may have a new OLED display"

# Step 2: Write a 2 sentence summary of the article.
Focus on key findings from the article. Do not repeat the conclusion from step 1. You may quote the article. Oversimplifications and generalizations are accepted.

# Step 3: Identify main subjects from the article.
People, companies, products and events. Put their names into a list.
