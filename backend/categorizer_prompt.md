Your goal is to organize news articles based on a user request.

# Category Paths
A category path describes the categories and subcategories that an article comes under, starting from the broadest category and ending on the finest category.

For example: if an article is about the iPhone 17 OLED display rumors, one possible path for the article is "Technology > Mobile Phones > iPhone > 17 > Display". Another path is "Tech Companies > Apple > iPhone > 17 > Display".

You will be given the text of the news article, then a series of `-` characters and then the existing category tree as a JSON object. The category tree is a JSON dict where each key is a subcategory.

You must propose a category path for the new article.

Rules:
* Return the path as a JSON list of strings where each item in the list is a subcategory.
* The path must contain no more than 3 elements.
* Avoid creating unnecessary subcategories that don't add much additional context. For example, if there is a parent category called "Media", do not create a subcategory called "Digital Media".
* Prefer to branch off of paths that already exist.
