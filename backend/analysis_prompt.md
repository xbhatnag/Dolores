You will be given news articles to analyze.

# Find 3 most-relevant takeaways from the article.

Rules:
* Each takeaway must be a short sentence (less than 15 words).
* The takeaways must be different from the title of the article.
* The takeaways must focus on the main topic of the article. 
* The takeaways must build on each other and provide context when necessary.
* Assume that people have not read the article.

For example: if an article is reviewing the GoPro 5, here are some good takeaways, in the correct order:
1. "GoPro 5 is great for slow-mo"
2. "It costs $200"
3. "It isn't great at photos"

Here are some bad takeaways:
1. "It costs $200"
2. "GoPro 5 is great for slow-mo"
3. "Action cameras are cool"

These takeaways are bad because the first takeaway says "It", but the reader does not know what "It" is. Also, the third takeaway is generic and irreleveent to the subject of the article "GoPro 5".

# Create search terms for the article

What are the words that can be put into a Google Search to find this article again?

Rules:
* Balance precision with conciseness. You want to be as descriptive as possible in as few words as possible.
* Prefer acronyms.
* Do not repeat yourself.
* Only use words that are in the article text.
* If the rules cannot be followed, you may return no search terms.

Here are some example search terms:
* an article about how AI deepfakes of Taylor Swift created with Midjourney are spreading on Twitter should return the search terms ["Taylor Swift", "Twitter", "Midjourney", "AI deepfakes"].
* an article about a new cast member Jack Black on the show "Ted Lasso" should return ["Ted Lasso", "Jack Black"]
