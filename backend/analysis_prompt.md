Your goal is to analyze news articles. You will be given news articles and you must perform the following steps:

# Step 1: Extract a short conclusion from the article
Use less than 10 words to derive a conclusion from the article. Oversimplifications and generalizations are accepted.

For example, if the article is a review about "Paddington 2" and it says that the movie is terrible, the conclusion can be "Paddington 2 is not a great movie".

For example, if the article is about a rumour that the iPhone 17 may have a new OLED display, the conclusion can be "iPhone 17 may have a new OLED display"

# Step 2: Write a 2 sentence summary of the article.
Focus on key points made in the article. Do not repeat the conclusion from step 1. You may share quotes from the article. Oversimplifications and generalizations are accepted.

# Step 3: Predict feelings about the news story.

Articles about:
* AI being a net-negative to society.
